# Covid19US

COVID19, caused by the SARS-CoV2 virus, is a global pandemic. In adults, COVID19 frequently causes Acute Respiratory Distress
Syndrome, may cause cardiomyopathy, and is lethal in 14+% of seniors older than 70 years. Given that U.S. cases of COVID19 are
growing exponentially, I wanted to create a visualization of U.S. data.

Though my coding experience is primarily in Python, I chose **R** and Shiny (plus GoogleVis) for this project. There are two
reasons for this: 1) I'm new to R and have been learning it in the context of Coursera's "Clinical Data Science" specialization, so I wanted to add more learning; 2) I find using Python and (Flask or Django) cumbersome for deploying web apps.

The data for this work come from [The COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/), a rigorous project with an excellent
API. Check 'em out on Twitter: [@COVID19Tracking](twitter.com/COVID19Tracking).
